Number One: Computer Animation</FONT></H2>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">In this module I worked with the program <I>Animation
Works, </I>a program copyrighted in 1991 with all the glory and technology
that was available five years ago. I worked with version 1.00.00, which
can never be a good thing, as the first released version of a program (though
not titled as such) could be concidered the beta test program . These are
used so that the programmers can get feedback from customers about how
well the program works, and discover possible glitches. With this slightly
corrupted program, I happened to create a simple animation with music and
sound, involving a virus, bomb, mass amounts of blood, and Wally. This
exact program will be of no technological use in the future, as it is already
five years old. Though that might not sound old, concider this : in 1991,
the fastest PC computer was a roaring 486/33Mgz with 8Mb of RAM. By todays
standards, that couldn't run a simple calculator program. The field of
computer animation, though, has allowed people to create 3D images, that
can be used in cartoons, simulations, and commercials for technical colleges
that advertise on TV. <I>Animation Works, </I>once one has figured out
how to work around the eminent problems, can be quite powerful, and one
can create impressive animations without ease. This station should introduce
the user to the technoloy of 3D rendering, for that is the direction much
computer animation is leaning towards.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">For more information about this quickly advancing
technology visit the <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/">Silicon Graphics</A>
website. Since Silicon graphics provides the majority of computers used
for computer animation, this site has information about their computers,
programs, and recent technological advances. . . Check out the Virtual
Lego Town reading! A company I would like to work for is <A HREF="http://www2.rcsnet.com/Rockwell/RCS/ELECTRONICARTS.1553">Electronic
Arts</A> . . .They make video games! EA has a location right in the Twin
Cities, and also in other places throughout the US. They are a rather large
company, and have been shelling out video games since the original Nintendo.

Number Two: Video Production</FONT></H2>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Summary of module: In this module, I worked with
<I>Video Director</I>, a seemingly powerful program for video editing.
I created a worthless interview with one of my friends that should have
turned out fine, but didn't. <I>Video Director,</I> even though I&nbsp;spent
an entire day to make sure it wouldn't, cut off the last couple seconds
of each clip that was put into the final video. Basically, Corey's last
words are lost, making the video look like it was produced in someone's
garage with two VCR's hooked up together. This technology will not affect
me in the future, for there wasn't much technology that I was working with
to begin with. But the advancing <I>real </I>technology that large companies
use will change the way movies are made, and therefore the way I see them.
There was not much I liked about this station. The worksheets were tedious
and boring, the program didn't work to my expectations, and my partner
did no work whatsoever! This station could be improved by making it more
interesting and exciting in <I>any </I>way. Who the ____ wants to create
a stupid interview, when there are action movies just waiting to be created
by a team of wanton teenagers? I have some comments to share, but they
wouldn't be appropriate.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">With computers and the whole lot, this technology
has been changing a bit over the years. For more information visit <A HREF="http://www.wcco.com">WCCO's</A>
website. News broadcasters use this technology all the time! At this website
you can find information about their company, among all kinds of other
stuff.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">I would like to work for <A HREF="http://www.lucasfilm.com">Lucasfilm</A>.
They made <I>Star Wars! </I>What's better than that? This company is off
in California somewhere, and is quite large. Ever since The Trilogy came
out, George Lucas has avoided making any movies. Now the first three are
coming out soon. Cool huh?</FONT></LI>

Number Three: Graphic Design</FONT></H2>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">In this module I&nbsp;used a Macintosh computer
and Canvas to create graphics. Canvas appears to be a rather powerful graphical
art program, but the Mac creates a balance and maintains the constant of
only so-so useful and user-friendly programs. I downloaded a graphical
file off of the Internet, changed the colors around, enlarged it, and printed
it on a shirt. That was fun! I doubt I&nbsp;have a future in seamstressing,
but the expirience with a computer art program could help a future in advertising,
among other things. I liked the fact that I&nbsp;could exercise absolute
control over T-Shirt printing in a normally democratic society. There is
not much room for improvement in this module, because you will get out
of it what you put in. If you take the time to brighten colors, convert
graphics and everything, you will have an awesome shirt. If you just double
click on some random ClipArt, and print it, your shirt will look horrible,
because you didn't try! Compared to the other modules, this one I think
was the most fun because of the end product, and the technology being used.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Graphic Arts is moving in the direction of computers.
Almost no one sits down at a desk, draws up something, and prints that
right onto a shirt, or whatever. For information about this technology,
check out </FONT><A HREF="http://www.digitalpage..com/design-prepress.html">Digital
Page Inc.</A><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">You will find information about different
graphical mediums, among other things.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">A Company using this technology that I might
like to work for would be : <A HREF="http://www.viablesoftware.com/vtouch/grappage.htm">Vegas
Touch</A> This company creates logos and catchy graphics for companies,
mainly for websites and other things. At their site you will find some
examples of their work.</FONT></LI>

Number Four: CNC Mill</FONT></H2>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">In this module I worked with the CNC Mill and
CNC Lathe machines, and produced 4 chess pieces. I made the rook! In the
future, I might be working with machines like this, but on a larger scale,
engineering machine parts, and the like. The thing I liked best was the
fact that I actually made something palpable in this module, not just learned
something. This is a great module, and I wish we had more here that followed
the same teaching mechanics...No packet, just make something by following
the tutorial guide. The packets are boring, and the lack of them in this
module made it fun! The only way this module could have been improved is
if the person who fashioned the design for the king made it more interesting
and less feminine! That makes a boring and feminine looking chess set!</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">There are many companies that use this technology
for more than just making chess sets. Check out the </FONT><A HREF="www.mts.com">MTS</A>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Homepage for more information. At this site, you
will find information about the company its self, and the technology they
both produce and use.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">I would like the work for <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">MTS&nbsp;Systems</A>.
It is a company located in Eden Prairie, along with many other cities over
the globe. MTS is a rather large company! They produce many things, with
road simulators being the majority. They were mentioned on Channel 9 News
last night! Channel 9 had a van equipped with some G force testing equipment,
and they drove through the biggest pot holes they could find!</FONT></LI>

Number Five: AutoCad</FONT></H2>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">In this module I worked with AutoCad. I made
many stupid drawings that the binder told me to do. If I&nbsp;become an
engineer, archeteicittsdact, or something like that, I will use this technology.
There was not much to like about this station. It is boring and tedious.
This station could be improved by not offering it. AutoCad is a good tool
to know how to use, but it doesn't need to be taught in school. There are
no comments that are appropriate to share, because there are young ears
nearby.</FONT></LI>

Number Six: Fiber Optics.</FONT></H2>

<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">In this module I&nbsp;learned about fiber optics.
I used fiber optic cables, sensors, transmitters, and these nifty little
detector, module things. I&nbsp;produced a sheet of paper with all the
answers to the numerous questions we were asked by the book. In the future,
fiber optics may be the medium for communication, so it will be useful.
This module is good. I&nbsp;enjoyed everything exept for the reading part.

they will need to utilize them!</FONT></LI>

to go to college, kill off many other smarter people, and proclaim myself
supreme ruler of the Earth.. Average starting salaries for someone in this
kind of a career is the half the average GNP of Russia.</FONT></P>
